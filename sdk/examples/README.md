PAP SDK Examples

This folder contains minimal examples that demonstrate:
- Emitting heartbeats as a liveness-only signal
- Emitting metrics separately via `event.metrics`
- Attaching OpenTelemetry IDs (`trace_id`, `span_id`) to envelopes for correlation

These samples are intentionally lightweight and do not require network access.
